hoverValue == 0 && index < starValue

This checks if hoverValue is 0 (meaning the user is not hovering over any star).

If hoverValue is 0, it further checks if index < starValue (i.e., whether the star at this index should be highlighted based on the saved rating).

If both conditions are true, the star gets the "gold" class.

index < hoverValue

This checks if the index of the star is less than the current hoverValue.

This means that when the user hovers over a star, all stars before (and including) it will get the "gold" class.

Final Logic (|| OR operator)

If either (hoverValue == 0 && index < starValue) is true OR index < hoverValue is true, the "gold" class is applied to the star.

Otherwise, the class is an empty string (""), meaning the star remains unstyled.

Summary:
If the user has not hovered (hoverValue == 0), then stars up to starValue (the saved rating) are colored gold.

If the user is hovering (hoverValue > 0), then stars up to hoverValue are colored gold.

Once the user moves the mouse away, the rating reverts to the saved starValue.
