# React Machine Coding Round Compilation

This repository contains a collection of frontend development projects built using React, specifically tailored for machine coding round problems commonly encountered in frontend interviews. Each project is self-contained and accessible via a central homepage, designed to demonstrate a wide range of practical UI challenges and React patterns.

## About

Each project is:
- Built using React and modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Designed to be modular and reusable
- Accessible from a common homepage for easy navigation
